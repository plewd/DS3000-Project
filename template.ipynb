    "Palworld is a unique survival crafting game that combines creature collection mechanics with base building and combat elements. In Palworld, players can capture, train, and utilize various Pals, each with distinct stats and abilities that affect their performance in different tasks such as combat, resource gathering, and base management. The game's economy includes a pricing system for Pals, which creates an interesting opportunity to analyze what factors drive their market value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the relationship between Pal characteristics and their prices has practical implications for players looking to optimize their gameplay strategies. By analyzing data from palworld.gg, a database of all Pals and their attributes, we can investigate which statistical features most strongly influence a Pal's price. Our primary research question is: **What combination of stats, elemental types, and rarity levels best predicts a Pal's price in the game?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis could help players make informed decisions about which Pals to prioritize for capture or breeding, and provide insights into the game's economic balancing mechanics.\n",

    "- Type Conversion: Converted numeric stat values from strings to integers where applicable, keeping non-numeric values as strings\n",
    "- Missing Value Handling: Initialized all stat fields with None values to handle cases where certain stats might be missing from a Pal's page\n",
    "- Element Formatting: Converted the list of elements for each Pal into a comma-separated string format for easier DataFrame storage\n",
    "- Data Flattening: Restructured the nested dictionary format (with separate Stats and Elements dictionaries) into a flat structure suitable for pandas DataFrame creation\n",
    "- Error Handling: Implemented try-except blocks to skip Pals that couldn't be properly scraped, preventing the entire process from failing due to individual page issues\n",
